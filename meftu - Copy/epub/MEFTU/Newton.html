<p>Newtonian Karma is a popular buzzword. One cannot underestimate the importance of it. I am sure that everyone is familiar with Newton's law that describes a force will be always met with an equal and opposing force. Applying this to Karma is very simple: a good deed will be matched with an equal good deed or a bad deed will be matched with an equal bad deed.</p>
<p>I discovered this is a child. My version of this was a little different. I observed, that if someone threw a punch, - unconditionally - someone else received a punch. And there can be no exceptions. If someone threw a punch, guaranteed someone else receives it. Even if it happened without the knowledge of parents, teachers, even if it happened behind closed doors the rule of punch could never be circumvented. </p>
<p>Newtonian Karma shows us that for every good or bad deed there is an equal and matching opposing good or bad deed. The interval upon which the equalization from the opposing deed takes place is specific to the particular instance. Some deeds yield in an immediate equalization, some deeds may take years or generations to equalize. One thing for sure, the Newtonian Karma will equalize, and the universe's balance will be restored. Just like the punches thrown and received are equalized. It all happens automatically, by the shear function of the universe. We do not have to do nothing to aid the equalization process.</p>
<p>This sets a new standard for desired behavior. Everything we do has an effect on the universe, and everything we do sets in motion a Newtonian Karma reaction. To that end â€¦.. Treat everyone as you would like to be treated. Correct every mistake as soon as you make it. Deal fairly, give as much as you take. Create a happy and prosperous environment, as good as you yourself want to have. Create abundance in equal proportions, matching your expectations to receive. </p>
<p>Exclude no one, every life matters. Newtonian karma will make no exception. Newtonian karma will not care about closed doors, about secret arrangements, about good intentions, bad intentions, about race, color, gender, wealth, education or association. It will simply restore the balance of the universe. No entity, no empire is strong enough to resist it. History proves it over and over.</p>
<p>For all of us, it is possible to deal in a way, that every party involved, benefits. In fact, if a deal was made, and only one party benefits and another party loses, it is called a fraud. Do not create a fraudulent situation, even is circumstances permit it. Karma will equalize your temporary gain. Operative word, temporary. Find a way to conduct your affairs so that everyone benefits. All the time. It is possible.</p>
<p>The alligator will death roll with everyone in the same direction. Do not believe you are an exception. Accept that the universe is greater and stronger than anyone, and acknowledge that it will restore it's balance no matter what your individual perception is. </p>
<p>I am sure if you reconcile this chapter with the 'Good and Bad' chapter you immediately notice the definition of Good and Bad is fluid. Good and bad is dependent on our value system, and on our point of view. This makes the Newtonian Karma particularly interesting. Newtonian Karma in vector space. Still true, still valid, but it may be a tad harder to navigate. Waver not, the universe will navigate it for you without fail.</p>
