</p>
<p>Imagine, you are walking down a country road, and behind the bushes you hear a snake rattle. It is warning you not to come any closer. You don't want your walk down the country road to turn to a deadly encounter, so you evade the bush and keep on walking. A couple of days later you're walking on the same path, and when you come to that very bush, you remember the encounter, and steer clear. You do not see or hear a snake, but your memory serves you, and protects you from another potential deadly encounter. </p>
<p>Congratulations. You just experienced post traumatic stress disorder. Please note that nothing happened to you and you did not even see the snake, but your memory and your self protection mechanisms created this pattern of behavior.</p>
<p>This is the same disorder that can be observed on veterans who return from active duty. Because their danger was real, the happening boundlessly graphic, the psychological effect is infinitely larger. But no one talks about the real reason of the post traumatic stress disorder. The great unbalance that was created. The unbalance that comes from a spiritual revulsion. And it is the following: there is no possible cause that can exist to compel one person to take another human's life. That is the inherent conflict. No possible reason can exist that justifies taking another person's life. Never.</p>
<p>The Empire is very good at convincing people otherwise. Good at giving reasons why it is honorable to take another human being's life. They create this mystery of an enemy, they convince everybody that is either us or them. Here, we are using the term 'Empire' very loosely, because in human history the Empire has changed, but the mission to convince people to be enemies have stayed constant. Of course looking at it from the other Empire's perspective, it is the same agenda from the opposite side of the coin. </p>
<p>It is sinful, that we humans permit the Empire to create that agenda. A relatively recent experience comes to mind, where a person armed with a handgun and a high definition camera videotaped the execution of a foreign national. The Empire immediately cried foul, convincing its population to drop bombs on the executioners and eradicate them from existence. I remember, the citizenry was ready to hate, and within days, most of them cheered the empire on.</p>
<p>Interestingly, no Empire took the following point of view: That person shot an innocent human being, let us find the chain of command upon which he will be made accountable for his actions. Because this view would not support the Empire's agenda, would not justify a giant weapon infrastructure, would not assist the hate machine, and would not play to the current way of the existence of the Empire. Thus the opposite was achieved. The empire's war machine destroyed the chain of command that potentially could hold the man accountable. Unfolding a fully blown conflict. Sad, that in history this horror happened over and over, and we did not learn.</p>
<p>We, the people have to put an end to this behavior. The whole human race. The Empire itself will never resolve to change this. None of the empires would. It is in their interest to keep homeostasis. The people have to disallow this conduct, to not permit it to exist in its current form. Then, and only then, the Empires will talk and resolve everything through legal means and negotiations. And then, only then can we hope for more happiness and world peace. We have achieved so much, we have the infrastructure in place, we are capable and willing to do it, all we need is the people to stand up and correct the Empire's behavior towards a more peaceful coexistence. </p>
