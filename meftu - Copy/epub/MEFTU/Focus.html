<p>The psychology teacher takes his class out to the side of a busy road. He asks the class to bring a notepad and a pencil, and instructs the students to count the number of red cars till the end of the hour.</p>
<p>He returns at the end of the hour, and asks the class: how many blue cars passed? The whole class was startled. They claimed, that they have been counting red cars. The teacher explained, that this was a metaphor for your focus in life. If you are counting red cars, you do not know how many blue cars passed by. If you are focusing on the bad things in life, you will never know how many good things in life you have.</p>
<p>There is a related phenomena that has been popular for a decade or so. It was the 'positive thinking' era. But positive thinking is an incorrect answer, because most of the positive thinking is done by ignoring the negative, sweeping it under the carpet. However, life is incomplete without the balance of the two. One has to acknowledge both the positive and the negative aspects of everything that is presented. While acknowledging both, you are free to choose your focus, and your focus may weigh with a little more emphasis towards the positive.</p>
<p>If you read the Good (friction) chapter, you know that the definition of positive and negative is fluid, they are merely vectors. The valuation of those vectors depend on your point of view. This automatically proves that you cannot ignore or sweep under the carpet either one of them, because every aspect has both a positive and negative side. It is a complex universe to navigate. With no compass, no guidance, no direction, it is hard to know what is the correct item to focus on.</p>
<p>There are some benchmark questions that guide you in your selection of choosing focus. For example, choosing focus on a particular item: Will this matter a decade from now? Will this item at focus help anybody? Will this item I'm focusing on help humanity? Create more happiness? Create more wealth? Create more comfort? Are there any other item(s) I should be focusing on instead? Items with greater impact?</p>
<p>When you're working with a team, the item at focus should be the item that empowers the team to continue the endeavor towards the end goal. When you're working individually the choice of focus item can be more liberal. You may pick a focus item that supports your vision, your dreams or items that underpin your ego.</p>
<p>The most fascinating aspect of focus is that it can be said with certainty, that your focus will determine your future, your focus will determine your success, and your focus will determine who you will become. Perhaps even more telling, that if you substitute the word 'focus' with the word 'choices' in this document, it will be equally true. Your choices to date determined where you are now, and who you are today, and your choices from now on will determine your success and who you will become. Make it in a way, that you will be worthy of imitating and deserving of being chosen as a role model.</p>
