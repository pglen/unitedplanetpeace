</p>
<p>Our existence is strongly interlinked with society. Things that we assume that are inalienable rights, things that we take for granted, are all provided to us by society. Admittedly we are contributors, but we cannot replace or substitute the powers that are given to us by society. Consider; would you be able to generate your own electricity? Would you be able to create a car for yourself? Would you be able to feed yourself (or your family) to the same standards afforded to you by participating in society?</p>
<p>The current and later stages of human history are strongly interlinked with - and connected to - society. Imagine you are on a desert island with no society around. How would you create the roads, the cars, the electronics. Even survival is at premium. Society gives us all these things we take for granted. </p>
<p>The reason why this is important to recognize, is because it makes us (inter) connected. It makes us interdependent. Dependent on each other. We are contributors, but we where not born that way. It takes a thorough education and a lot of hard work to be able to usefully contribute. As society advances, it takes more and more education and more hard work to be able to have useful contribution. This comes at a high price. And here it is: </p>
<p>Because it is harder and harder to contribute, more and more people are falling to the way side. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the 'falling to the wayside' has severe consequences. Consequences that affect our everyday life. This is why we have more and more homeless, and more and more outcasts. They are appearing on the streets and in most every aspects of life. It is not particular to any country or any culture, this is a symptom of society requiring a higher and higher degree of preparedness for useful contribution. Even though our productivity as well as our created 'value' has reached apparent maximum, for many of society members, it has reached minimum.</p>
<p>There is no other way to cope with this phenomena, but to apply compassion and humbleness. Society's advances created this gap. It was inevitable, we have to deal with it. Strong measures should be taken to pull everybody up to the level of useful contribution. In cases, that it is not possible, compassion is of utmost importance. We have to make sure, that we meet those members of society's basic needs, and assist them into human dignity. At the final count, people who fell on the wayside, are not at fault. It comes out of the workings of all that came before. We should not blame them, but accept, that it is the result of a change, that they had no control over. This is especially important with the elderly population. How we permit them dignity, how we meet their basic needs is a test of who we are as a society.</p>
<p>The 'wayside and unfortunate' do not need judgment. They need somebody to tell them it is going to be okay. They need somebody who helps them. They need somebody who understands them. Feeling unappreciated and useless manifests itself severely. It is not uncommon that those members of society turn to drugs, alcohol, mass murder. It is society's best interest to afford them human decency, human dignity, which may prevent the suffering and atrocities that ensue.</p>
