</p>
<p>For centuries, possibly millenniums, mankind existed in small groups. These small groups can be thought of as a family, an extended family or a tribe. Only later, after the process of tribal existence, was mankind able to form a society. Because of this long history of tribal existence, our brain has evolved to only process information flow from an extended family or tribe. Anything more than that, creates an overflow that we cannot process. </p>
<p>For example, a news about a murder that happened 2000 miles away, reaches - on average - 300 million people. The huge number of people that the news footage reached, will look over their shoulder, with a little bit of worry (especially in the dark) for a while. This worry is induced by the news footage, because our brain is incapable of comprehending the 300,000,000 to 1 ratio. That is a ratio that is roughly equivalent of a chance of winning the jackpot on the lottery. Our brain cuts off at the ratio of the average number of tribal members. (plus or minus an order of magnitude) We cannot comprehend several orders of magnitude difference.</p>
<p>Because of this overload, our brain is incapable of handling global news feed. The response is fatigue, exclusion, indifference or simply closing the information channel. (like avoiding any news) As globalization happens, the Global Village is replacing the Tribal Village. We need to re-train our human Tribal Brain to our Global Village Brain. While the training of the tribal brain took thousands of years, we only have a short period of time to retrain our brain to the global information flow. Where retrain is not possible, awareness helps a great deal.</p>
<p>An important aspect of global village is global tolerance. Remember, in the tribal age, a member of the next tribe needed to be excluded. It was treated as an outsider, and in extreme circumstances was treated as an enemy. Especially, when the next tribe was competing for the same food source. But in the age of the global village, that is no longer the case. It is no longer desirable, and it is no longer an option. We need to expand our understanding, lower our threshold of expectations, embrace diversity. Diversity and variety is what gives globalization its power. Globalization is such a powerful force, that it may irrevocably unify all of mankind. Anyone who resists, anyone who insist on old models of thinking will experience hardship or simply will be left behind.</p>
<p>Relics of the tribal age are still visible in several religions. Some of them contain arrangements to keep the other tribe's or other religion's members as outsiders. The religions themselves were created in an age where this was an essential arrangement. They could only create concepts from their vantage point, and where limited by the distance they could see. We could see further today, and should not be afraid to challenge concepts that have been created with limited visual distance.</p>
<p>In the global village age, there are no outsiders and everyone needs to be embraced. Everyone needs to be treated like a member of our own tribe, our own religion, our own extended family. As a member of our own human nation. Accepting this might be difficult, but it is the easiest and safest way for global peace and happiness. </p>
<p>You may personally manifest this when you encounter a stranger. Do not see a stranger. Instead, see a (possible) future friend, or see another, equal human being. A being that needs a friend as much as you do. Or a human who needs to be helped, assisted, supported or accompanied on the journey of a happier life. </p>
