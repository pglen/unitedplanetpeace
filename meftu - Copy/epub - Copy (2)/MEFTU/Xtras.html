<p>The universe is full of magic and full of wonders. If you are curious, if you are receptive, you will never be bored in your life. Here are some of the universe's curious and interesting items.</p>
<p>Ever wondered if you where drop shipped anywhere on the planet, if you could find your way back home? If you would be able to discover where your at? Let's start with the basics. </p>
<p>In most places, there are trees around. And looking at any tree you can immediately tell the tilt of the crown. On the equator, the tilt of the crown is horizontal. Moving away from the equator, the tilt of the tree crown points to the highest energy impact, where the sun light is coming from. It turns out the angle of this high energy impact is the exact same angle as the latitude the tree is on. You can confirm this by looking at pictures from Georgia or pictures from Massachusetts and compared the tilt of the tree's crowns.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If there are no trees around, but you see water, you receive a different clue. For instance in Florida the water has a greenish hue. (from dissolved copper ...) In the Bahamas water has a bluish hue. In fact the location of every body of water is recognizable with the little bit of observation powers. </p>
<p>No trees no water … if you look at sand, for instance, the Arizona desert has a very different color compared to the Sahara desert. The extra sulfur makes the Sahara desert comparatively yellow. In fact, you can tell where you are within the Sahara desert by looking at the shades of the sand, parts of it have a reddish hue showing traces of iron. There are no limits of how much observation you can do in the universe … Create your mental map. The only limit is you.</p>
<p>Look at a photograph. If the photograph was taken in the northern parts of the world, it has a cold bluish blue. If the photograph was taken in the Equatorial parts of the world, it has a warm yellowish hue. (Angle of sun light) One would argue, that this is an effect that is overpowered by the technological differences between the photographs. Not so. <b>Our intuition adjusts to the hue </b>of the photograph as soon as we identify an object that we are familiar with. </p>
<p>We can tell if a dog is smiling. Or a cat is in distress. They are very different creatures from us, yet we can tell their emotional state with certainty. How is that possible? It turns out that they are not that different. In a human being, the major emotions (fear / happiness / pain … etc) are connected to specific facial muscle groups. In the animal kingdom those major emotions are connected to the exact same muscle groups. That is why we recognize the emotional state of most every mammal. Talk about the connected universe. Indeed we are one with them, we need to respect all creatures.</p>
<p>When we are calm, content, idle and at peace, we build a good map of the universe in our heads. You are in charge of the universe you build within you. Do not build it in anger, bitterness and hostility. Rather, build it with curiosity, naivety, happiness and enthusiasm. Repair the parts that you built when learning the wrong lesson, revise the parts that you built with insufficient information. Be liberal on what you accept and be conservative of what use as a building block. For inspiration, look at an infant building his / her universe with naivety and curiosity. Never let go of that.</p>
<p>They say, that we gravitate towards people who build a similar universe within them. Build yours in a way, that it is worth gravitating towards.</p>
