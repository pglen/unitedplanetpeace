</p>
<p>Every now and then, in a place of great wealth, I address a stranger with the following question: Do you own a slave? Needless to say, I get strange looks. The first reaction of the people that I asked this question to, is that they very strongly disclaim owning a slave. This question resonates especially loud in a place where there is a history of slavery. Of course after the initial shock wears off, my next questions are: Did you make your underwear? Did you make your socks? Did you slaughter the chicken that you had for lunch this week? Did you make your car?</p>
<p>Now I get mixed reactions. The stronger they disclaimed owning a slave, the more I can see that I brought something into their attention they have never ever considered. Indeed, somebody had to make those socks, somebody had sewn the underwear. And yes, most likely, that somebody was paid minimum wage or less, working in inhumane conditions, in a cellar somewhere in the middle of a place we never heard of. So the answer is yes, that person in a place of great wealth, wearing regular clothing, made by minimum wage labor, does own a slave. How did we get this far?</p>
<p>Maximizing productivity, pressing for lower price is a natural and healthy mechanism of competition. But how did we get from this healthy mechanism to virtual slavery? Why are we - who are strong - did not stand up for the millions who live below the poverty line, virtually enslaved. Why are those who take profits of virtual slavery have no conscience? Why did they allow a creation of a system that created this unacceptable outcome.</p>
<p>Far from me to question status quo. It is the result of all that came before. Reluctantly, I accept. However, I do not accept that it should continue. Those who are in power, those who are in profit, should change this virtual slavery to an acceptable existence. Nothing radical, just a humane attitude that allows this shameful state to migrate into a humanly acceptable way of life.</p>
<p>Remember, no empirical attitude permits to treat the other human being as a lesser one. (see looks chapter) There are benefits to creating a humble and humane environment. Experience shows, that a humane environment is more productive, creates more value, and is in balance that it does not need to be maintained by force.</p>
<p>This may sound contradictory, but this virtual slavery exist even in the richest of places. Law and Order allows the few to subdue the many - into virtual slavery. Naturally this un-balance is temporary. History has shown us, that the universe will restore its balance. The question is, will the balance be restored by assuming a humane attitude and pulling the lower ranks up, or will the balance be restored by pulling the higher ranks down. Either way I hope it will be done without force, without sudden moves, unexpected side effects, without great suffering, serving greater happiness.</p>
<p>The universe will restore its balance. The question is at what cost. Will it require those in excess wealth to voluntarily hand down or to compromise. Will it require that those in virtual slavery to force a collapse from below. Will it be a hybrid of the two? Will automation and robotics save us? </p>
