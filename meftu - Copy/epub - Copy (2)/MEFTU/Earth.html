</p>
<p>I recall when they sent televised pictures from the Apollo moon landing. One of the images was a beautiful blue sphere, with intricate patterns of clouds and outlines of continents. It was a breathtaking moment to introspect our whole planet as one fragile blue globe.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was the very first image, that hinted on mankind's existence as inhabitants of that beautiful blue sphere. It looked so intricate, so fragile, so unified, that one could not help but think of it as such. For one brief moment, humanity was one big family. </p>
<p>We are one big family. Take a look at an infant child. He/she trusts everything. Smiles all the time, does not know the difference between one person or the other. Into this blank slate, we can materialize everything that a human being needs. To survive, to grow up, to be happy, peaceful and complete. Instead into this blank slate with fill in hatred, poison, fear, discrimination. Why? Gone are the times when the tribe next door was the enemy, because they have to compete for territory and food. We have such abundance, that if we learn to share it, that if we learn to distributed evenly, everybody can call grow up complete and happy.</p>
<p>So what happened? Why the poison? Why the hatred? It is because we grew up in an environment that inherited this psychological foundation from the tribal era. We need to break this cycle. And the only way to break it, is to be aware of this tribal heritage, and expand into the mindset of a global society. Very unfortunate that this poisonous environment continues today on the planet, because people with means did not care about breaking this toxic cycle. We all have to participate and care. And show a better example.</p>
<p>By this century we are so powerful that we can annihilate each other multiple times. Breaking the poison cycle is not only important, it is critical. Look at the mechanics of war. Just one picture of the troops with their military leader tells the whole story. And here's how the story goes. A middle-aged leader on the front, and a lot of boys behind him. Boys in their teens or early twenties. How did they convince all of those teens to take up arms and point rifles at another human being?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these teen's blank slate have been filled up with poison, justification and judgment. It is no coincidence, in most pictures, no middle-aged person is behind the military leader. By the time a person reaches his/her middle age, he or she already possesses the understanding of the value of life. By that age, the person understands the hypocrisy of the empire(s) that tries to convince anyone from killing. Our task, is to educate the value of life to everyone, especially including those that may hold the rifle on the battlefield. Both on this, and on the other side of the planet.</p>
<p>Take a look at the person next to you. He or she is more similar in every way than different. So why do we focus on the difference? How can we justify war? How can we sanctify killing? From now on, there is no justification, to take a single life. Instead, form a society in balance, and create law and order, peace and happiness by other means than taking a life. Remember the ultimate balance sheet of history. Of any war, we look at the losses of lives of the aggressor side, is about the same as the losses on the assaulted side. If and when we wage a war, are we ignorant enough to think that our balance sheet will be different? Those who ignore history tend to repeat its failures.</p>
