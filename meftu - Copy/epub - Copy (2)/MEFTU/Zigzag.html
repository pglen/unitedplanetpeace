</p>
<p>Zig or Zag. Our life is full of choices. Nothing affects us more, than the sum of our choices. In fact, the very place we are at right now, the very environment we are surrounded with, the emotional disposition, the financial state, and pretty much everything else is the sum of all of our choices.</p>
<p>When we look back, we can see if our choices were made according to the greatest outcome. Do we accept the choices we made? Forgive the pun, but we have no choice but to accept the choices we made. But once we accept it, and accept the place we are at, healing and progress can begin.</p>
<p>As you read it in different chapter, we build a transcript (copy) of the universe in our heads. We are totally in charge of this universe we build with in us, and parts of that universe comes from the choices we made. It is always easy to see in hindsight what choices were good and what choices were bad. Most of the times, the bad choices we made are the truly educational ones. We learn more from our failures than from our successes. So why would we want to deny the choices that taught us the most?</p>
<p>We are the product of all those choices. The virtual universe we built within, the universe that surrounds us is the result of the compound ancillary happenings that came before. Much like a palm tree, it stands strong, undeniable. So how do we create harmony and that in that virtual universe? For starters, we need to unlearn and demolish all the virtual items that we created with insufficient information. Let me give you an example from my life.</p>
<p>As a child I was watching TV, and I've seen the laboratory workers do very important things in white lab coats. I was inspired by that, and I wanted to be a scientist with a white coat, working in a laboratory. However if I look at my life today, even though I am creating life-changing innovations, I am not wearing a white laboratory coat. I built that expectation, when I had insufficient information to build it.</p>
<p>We all build these misguided expectations. For example, we have 'clear' idea of what our mate should look like. (muscles curves etc â€¦) Where we want to live. What type of people we want to be, or surrounded with. What kind of job we want to have. These expectations are all created before we knew enough about life to create them. We have to take steps to erase those expectations. Now this is not easy. Think of a chalkboard that we filled up with all kinds of scribble, and we need to erase most of it.</p>
<p>But once this metaphorical chalkboard is erased, now we are ready to receive the universe as it is, to start our life anew. We can begin living life in harmony with the universe, and it will open up new frontiers. It will initiate new beginnings and it will create unbelievable abundance and happiness. This enlightening thought, this enlightening phase of life, where we become in harmony with the universe is what many call salvation. You may find yours, all you have to do is erase your chalkboard of expectations, and become one harmonious being with the universe.</p>
<p>The reward is beyond expectations. And it is all happening within you. No need to involve any higher power, any external influence, it comes simply by the workings of You and the universe.</p>
