</p>
<p>We are in the first quarter of the twenty first century. We have tamed most of the rivers, contained most of the lakes, found cure for most ailments, created astonishing technological achievements, but we are still coming short of uniting mankind for greater understanding, peace and happiness.</p>
<p>These set of messages are set out to fill that mission. It is a collection of short stories. Just as every story one tells, these stories are painted with a little bias towards glorifying what happened. Read it with care, and attempt to see beyond the lines, words, and sentences to interpret the true meaning we wish to communicate.</p>
<p>An important thing in our journey of life, is to include everybody into that flow. Every single life matters. No need to make a distinction between gender, ethnicity, religion, social status, accumulated wealth, perceived power and race. The universe will deliver message after message (and treat one) without regards to any of those distinctions. </p>
<p>The reason I started writing this collection of messages, is that the universe compelled me to give back some of the good I received. In my life, I had the fortune to live in different countries, spanning different continents. The luxury of making friends from different cultures, enduring hardships, enjoying triumphs. In my journeys I learned how important it is to be an honorable and humble human being. I learned the importance of help and generosity. I learned the importance of humane treatment of all that surrounds us and all that binds us. And I learned to treat everybody kindly and with acceptance and wisdom. Despite all that separates us.</p>
<p>I hope you will arrive to your own conclusions from this collection. Empower you to boldly go where no one has gone before. Let us create this new world of happiness, peace, coexistence and harmony. After centuries of unnecessary conflict we can stop fighting and manifest mankind as one united happy and productive group.</p>
