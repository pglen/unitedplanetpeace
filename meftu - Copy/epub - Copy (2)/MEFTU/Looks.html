<p>A famous saying from the past, which I am sure everyone is familiar with, talks of a dream where a person is judged by his/her character and not by the color of his skin. I would go even further. I wish, I dream, that a person is judged by his character and by his actions, and not judged by what he wears, how he dresses, how he smells, what he looks like, how he talks, where is he is from, what language or accent he speaks with, what's religion he is a member of. </p>
<p>There is a fine line we have to walk when applying judgment. In nature, judgment could be a matter of survival. Unfortunately we apply judgment even if we do not have survival level issues. I have observed many time, two people meeting the first time, asking where each other is from, and after establishing each others places of origin, an immediate pecking order ensues. The strangest part is that both were from a different country relative to the place of their meeting. Their original preconceptions of - prescribed pecking order - reestablished itself . One was looking down on the other based upon empirical history, that had nothing to do with neither person, nothing to do with their current country, nothing to do with anything other than old-fashioned empirical judgment.</p>
<p>This judgment can be so strong, that the dominant person does not care about the perceived lesser one. We are talking about two strangers in a third country, and judgment put them back into their original frame of empirical pecking order. Because the dominant person did not care about the lesser one, the interaction went as far as a literal invasion of the other. It was interesting to observe, that this invasion is how one empire justifies nullifying the other. </p>
<p>Of course today we know the backbone of this is that both human beings are equal. No distinction should be made or can be made between them. The two are equal in every possible and imaginable way. For example one possesses strengths in one direction, the other has strengths in a different direction. Summarizing the strengths of each individual, they are equal. (as opposed to identical) There can be no assumption of pecking order, no justification of the invasion, and no account of any discriminating treatment. </p>
<p>Once the equality is understood, new possibilities are given birth to. Differences and diversity can be a source of enormous strength. Examining history, every empire that embraced these differences, and took advantage of the power of diversity was a successful empire.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the thinking that allows the phrase 'successful empire' is an outdated model of thinking. Instead of a 'successful empire' slogan, wee need to allow for the beginning of happier human race. The outdated thinking of one empire's success depends upon another empire's hardship should be replaced with every empire can be successful in creating the happier human race. </p>
<p>Even in today's world, some empires exclaim 'Look at our achievements' 'Look at our great language' 'Look at our wealth' and keep silent about the cost of those achievements. The suffering, the homelessness, the invasion of the lesser empire (by whatever means) all speak to the false identity of this model. The new model should aim for equality, empowerment, happiness, freedom, self-expression, tolerance, both inside and outside of the empire, embracing the whole of mankind.</p>
