</p>
<p>For the better part of a century, we were puzzled about the bumblebee. Being a big bee, having small wings. How can it fly? Measurements have been taken, calculations have been laid out, and applying all the formulas that we build airplanes with, we can clearly demonstrate that the bumblebee cannot fly.</p>
<p>This has puzzled scientists, philosophers and ordinary people. Despite, that we can mathematically and scientifically prove that the bumblebee cannot fly, the bumblebee does not know about this, it just flies. How can that be? What makes the bumblebee fly? </p>
<p>Not until the middle of the century, could we explain the bumblebee's flight. With the advent of high-speed cameras, we could observe that the bumblebee's wings touch when they reach the top. They squeeze out the air from between them, and when they separate, they create a vacuum. This vacuum effect accounts for the missing force.</p>
<p>The humble bumble. We have to admit, pretty curious, that even a simple thing as the bumblebee's flight puzzled us for a historical length of time. The only way we can internalize this, is that we have to be humble. Introspection tells us, that the bumblebee phenomena is not the only puzzle needing humbleness. For instance, when they launched the Hubble space telescope, they established that the universe is 4.x billion years old. They stated it with confidence, they even had an accurate number, and mankind accepted it as fact. Years later with advances in instrumentation and low noise sensors, we established that the universe is now 8.x billion years old. Which one is it?</p>
<p>One thing was missing from these scientific advances. Humbleness. Would they have admitted, that it is a conclusion based upon what we can see today, all would have been forgiven. But they drew actual conclusions, and stated hypotheses with certainty. Looking at the human dynamics, and the society that measures it, physicists wanted to produce something tangible for their tenure. Would they have been surrounded with a humble society, requiring humbleness, this is how this discovery would have been announced: With our instrumentation today, we see 4 billion years into the past. And then years later the announcement would have worded similar with the 8 billion year number. Sadly, as of today, the announcement stands in its original form with no trace of humbleness.</p>
<p>We have limited capacity to comprehend things. There are things that are beyond our mental reach. Things that we are not meant to know. Remember when the cavemen had seen lightning, that lit a tree on fire. He believed it to be supernatural. Today, lightning is a well-known phenomena. Our challenges expand to more complex and more abstract observations. Are we humble enough to state them as we see them, to state them as a theory, to state them as an instance of our ever involving knowledge? Are we humble enough as a society to demand to be stated as such?</p>
<p>The universe is a large and complex place. We really are not meant to comprehend it all. Let's look at our brain's internal workings. We are looking at our brain with a scientific instrument, attempting to comprehend its internals. But we are using that same brain to evaluate our observations. The more we we understand about our brains workings, the more complex our brain gets. The more complex our brain gets the more studies we have to do, thus entering a forever spiraling loop. We are not meant to do that. Especially in light of our bumblebee conundrum.</p>
