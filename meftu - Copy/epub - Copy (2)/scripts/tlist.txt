The apple does not fall far from 
The magic of bumblebee's flight 
Everybody is a little controller 
Nature's answer to continuity 
The blue ball of the moon landing
The focus you keep, is who you are
The good the bad and the universe 
Unclogging the obstruction 
The traits of society 
How not to be a comedian 
The ever shifting table dirt 
The dream I have 
The neighboring interaction 
Equal and opposing forces 
The power of tradition 
The spiritual Quantum Physics 
Looking for answers 
Our spiritual side 
In the bushes 
Comprehending Tribal roots 
Hidden slaves 
Of the spirit 
For a better world 
Miracles and wonders 
The center of the universe 
Of choices
