</p>
<p>Not far from where I reside, there is a small river flowing into the sea. Every time I crossed the bridge on that river, I observe the tide is carrying the water. Sometimes the water is flowing towards the ocean and sometimes the water is flowing towards the land, and some of the time, it is stationary. One time while looking at the river, I considered, that very water molecule, that is under the bridge right now, how does it know which way to flow?</p>
<p>Well, that molecule doesn't know which way to flow. But it knows its neighbor. And the neighbor molecule knows its neighbor, and so forth until we arrive to the forces that affect the water to flow up or down the river. This means the molecule that is under the bridge, is connected via other molecules to the moon by way of nearest neighbor interaction. In fact it is connected to the whole universe. For example the planet Jupiter affects are tide, so the molecule under the bridge is affected by Jupiter.</p>
<p>The whole universe is connected. Wow. The strength of the connectivity is assigned by the reverse square distance rule. The further something is, the less effect it has. But it has effect no matter how far it is. This has enormous anthropoid implications. If anyone suffers, the whole humanity experiences it. If millions suffer, the whole humanity endures that as well. If one human is happy, the whole humanity feels it. As the universe is connected, the connection is unconditional, there can be no exceptions.</p>
<p>It is all too easy to separate ourselves as individuals, and believe we are the exception. We think these rules do not apply to us. But no man is an island. No man can succeed without everyone succeeding. So people who are successful, need to be humble, and acknowledge everyone else's contribution. People who succeeded, need to share that success. Especially if they succeed on the backs of many. No man ever created large abundance by himself on a desert island.</p>
<p>Excessive abundance is only possible by exploitation. We, as humanity, have total power over not permitting that. Simply, the universe is built that way, we just have to encourage its mechanism. Even karma works as prescribed. Almost, without exception, people with excessive abundance are unhappy, isolated, fear driven and dejected. People with excessive abundance surrendered their life to it. They are too busy protecting and maintaining that abundance, never experiencing true life.</p>
<p>Many times, excessive abundance is a result of false learning. That person, when experiencing unnecessary hardship, had this faulty take away. He / she learned that no one takes care of them, so when next time they have an opportunity, they take care of themselves. This manifests itself as greed and hoarding. Had we had a society, that took care of unnecessary hardship, he / she would not have had the false learning, and as a result, we would not have the excessive abundance (greedy) layer of humanity.</p>
<p>We are all molecules in a great sea of humanity. No molecule is more important than the other, and no molecule is less important. Each and every one of us can change whole humanity, by affecting the molecule next to us. When you see suffering - instead of judgment - assist with a helping hand. When you see hunger, offer food. When you see thirst offer water. When you see mental anguish, offer mental nourishment. All you have to do is affect the molecule next to you. The rest will fall into place.</p>
