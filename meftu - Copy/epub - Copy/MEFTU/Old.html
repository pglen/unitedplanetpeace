<p>If you look at a tree in your neighborhood (or a bush if you don't have trees around you) ask the question: how did it get there? Why is it there? Why not 10 feet to the left or 3 meters to the right? The answer to that question is: reality. Reality as it is now. Everything that came before, resulted in what we see today, including that tree in that place.</p>
<p>It looks like such a simple assumption, but most people do not have the respect to see reality as it is. They assume a point of view that is convenient to them, and are blind to the actual reality that surrounds them. But the aforementioned tree is firmly planted, and in most cases, even a hurricane can not harm that tree. It would be foolish to ignore reality as it is. It is strong, it is powerful, it just is. And it is the result of everything that came before.</p>
<p>The proof of not seeing reality as it is, can be witnessed by observing particular country's elections. To start with, most countries have a somewhat oppressive regime. With the wave of democracy propagating worldwide, they all believed in a fresh start, and elected new (democratic like) leadership. So far so good, but after two to four elections, they tend to re-elect an old (oppressive like) regime. And this did not happen to some of them, but happened to ALL of them.</p>
<p>If you recall all of these events, you immediately wonder what is the message the universe is trying to convey? The answer is stated above. We are not seeing reality as it is. Had those countries approach change to democratic governance in a gradual process, everything would have worked out as intended. Ignoring the current state of reality creates this outcome. Very unfortunate, that this creates indescribable hardships. I hope, we will be wiser in the future.</p>
<p>Only a few times in history it is appropriate to ignore the current state of reality. Sometimes, things need to be rebuilt from the ground up. Our wisdom is called upon to recognize when we can ignore the current state. It really comes down to a recognition between evolutionary change and revolutionary change. There are no hard and fast rules to apply on that determination. Perhaps, asking cooperation from all corners of the universe, including the adversary in play. This permits us to avoid the hardship associated with the revolutionary change. Please do not mix up the term 'revolutionary change' with 'revolution'. Revolutionary change can take place in science, in religion, in medicine and almost any associated aspect of life. Shortchanging the meaning of the word would be giving in to fear.</p>
<p>A final thought on respecting reality as it presents itself. A phenomena called 'Peer Reinforcement'. Many times I observe a small group of people agree on something, and they concur that what they believe, is what reality is. It is an easy mistake to make, and possibly one of the most harmful fault any group can have. History has a multitude of occurrences of this. Millions and millions of people have been killed by this 'Peer Reinforcement' righteousness. One of the safest ways to avoid 'Peer Reinforcement', is to include people in the group with opposing points of views. Then, weigh all input before establishing your view on 'Reality' (Note the quotes). </p>
<p>In the information age, establishing your picture of reality is of paramount importance. Luckily, this very information age that makes it so important, also helps on navigating it. And do not forget, when you see reality, you see all that came before. Your elders, your surroundings, your current state. Respect them. </p>
