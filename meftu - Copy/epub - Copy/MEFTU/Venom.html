<p>Remember the ultimate balance sheet of history? Of any and all wars, if we look at the losses of the attacker side versus the attacked side, they endure about the same losses of lives. Thousands of years of human history, and not a single exception. But, every empire that starts a conflict, believes they will be an exception to this balance sheet. Still, to date, there is not a single one. </p>
<p>Those who ignore history tend to repeat its failures. The question arises, are we ignorant enough to think that our balance sheet will be different? Are we unlearned enough to think, that we can repair our own economy at the cost of lives? By hate peddling? By conflict mongering? </p>
<p>Let me we give you a recent example of conflict mongering. The names have been omitted / changed to protect the guilty. The story goes: in a far far away land, somewhere in the desert, a gun man executed a journalist on camera. We have all seen it in the news, and witnessed it with horror. What comes next is the fascinating part. The empire cried foul, wanted revenge. Immediately jumped into conclusions on attacking, dropping bombs, annihilating. Instead of stating, that there is a person that broke the law, let's find a way to legally make him accountable, the empire started a conflict mongering campaign. </p>
<p>This all played out in front of us as a barreling of news footage. Showing the true colors of the empire. Are we ignorant enough not to remember the balance sheets of history? Maybe it is too late for us. Maybe conflict and war accompanied us for too long. But it is not too late for the new generation. We need to teach the new generation to not permit the empire to instill conflicts, not to solve matters with weapons. There is always a way without arms.</p>
<p>Sadly, we are teaching the new generation a different lesson. There are more armed conflicts today than at any time in history. But there is hope. When a child is born, he/she is full of innocence, happiness and joy. Our innate traits supports peace and harmony. All we need to do is NOT teach them the venom we learned. Which is harder than it looks, but it has to start today.</p>
<p>We do not have a choice, we have to stop the wars. Weapons have became so powerful, that we have enough weaponry to destroy the whole of humanity many many times over. We have to acquire the reasons to refrain from starting conflicts. The ground for peace is really simple. Human beings are more alike than different. Because we are more alike, we mostly consume the same things, we are happy about the same things and we suffer the same way. We have no secrets from each other. </p>
<p>When there are secrets, there is greed, there is suffering, there is hate. A great test of any empire is how many secrets they have. A good measure of secrets is how hard it is to get security clearance. Empires that have difficult security clearance procedures, are the ones with the most secrets, are the ones with the most judgment, most conflicts, most greed, most hate. Interestingly, the difficulty of obtaining a security clearance is directly proportional to the ratio of homeless within that empire.</p>
