</p>
<p>They say if you believe, no explanation is needed, if you do not believe, no explanation is possible. Potentially, this is the reason why there are so many anomalies arising from religion. Instead of focusing on the commonality we lock onto the difference. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The commonality is easy to find. Human beings are spiritual beings. We all need salvation, we all need guidance, we all need something to believe in. To this end, religion is a manifestation of our spiritual need. Unfortunately - over mankind's history - religion evolved differently in different territories. Religion became specific to areas, specific to languages, specific to the needs of the current ruler. The greatest proof of religion is specific to area / language, is that country borders also present themselves as religion boundaries.</p>
<p>In the time of globalization, those religious differences manifest themselves. This imposes great suffering, creating hardship where there is no hardship necessary. All we have to do, is focus on the human need for spirituality. Find what is common in us. Once we arrive to that greater wisdom, we can accept anybody's and everybody's religion. Corollary, we can count on that our religion will be accepted by others.</p>
<p>The time of global village has arrived. With the information age, information travels freely, ignoring and transgressing once insurmountable borders and boundaries. We have no choice but to adapt to this new situation. We have to contend with every religion, every faith, every belief. Not just accept it but welcome it, embrace its diversity. History has proved us, the happiest the strongest and the most successful entity was the one that embraced diversity. It is the true image of the universe, we have to accept this reality as it is presented.</p>
<p>Not accepting this reality leads to hate. Hate leads to anomalies, confrontations, fear, suffering, even wars. Possibly the saddest report card on humanity is that in the 21st century we still have active wars. Further, we have more wars today than any time in history. Hundreds of thousands if not millions of humans are displaced, most people cannot find their self-expression, and whole generations cannot find their path for contribution to society. All of those can be stopped with the following simple mental exercise: Acceptance, tolerance, letting go of obsolete values, letting go of greed, and fear. Helping each other, nourishing the ones in need, and treating the disadvantaged with honor.</p>
<p>There are recent initiatives that prove, we have already entered the path of universal acceptance and peace. The people in need receive more and more help. Jut the other day, I walked by a private house with a commercial refrigerator at the end of the driveway. The fridge was stuffed with food, and displayed the sign: Take what you need, donate if you can. Enterprises like these show me, that the good outweighs the bad, and we are on the right track for creating human dignity and universal peace. </p>
<p>Perhaps another step, is when we recognize that if every person refused to hate, if every soldier refused to fight, if every worker refused to create weapons, if every supplier of aggression would stop supplying aggression, wars would stop. And the few who bully the people into conflicts and create hardship, would never ever again would be able to do so.</p>
