</p>
<p>Let's create a hypothetical scenario. From the upstairs bedroom, you walk down to the kitchen and open the refrigerator. From the fridge, there is a large and tasty looking cookie, and a glass of milk smiling at you. The obvious thing happens, you eat the cookie and drink the milk. This makes you sleepy you go back to bed.</p>
<p>In hypothetical scenario, the next morning you wake up a little groggy. You go downstairs only to find cookie crumbles and an empty glass of milk on the kitchen counter. Then you suddenly realize: how can I expect to control anybody else, if I cannot control myself?</p>
<p>This leads to a very serious set of directives. The most obvious one, that if you cannot control yourself, how do you expect to control others. The directives derived go on and on â€¦ to constricting spoken language. One has to be very careful about constructs that involve the word 'must' and 'should' that targets a second or third person. (like: 'you should') Every time you hear somebody using these constructs, it is wrong. If you cannot control yourself, how do you expect to control others?</p>
<p>When you see or hear somebody using this kind of language, you can be assured that it is a person with no power, no trust and no responsibility. Because anyone who thinks they can approach the universe with that kind of a control, misses the fundamental nature of the universe as well as the nature of human interaction. Even powerful dictators cannot assume this kind of control in the long term.</p>
<p>I am sure that you recall or recognize people around you who use this control language on a regular basis. You can compare notes here and mentally confirm this observation. But there is more. Not only is this construct wrong in grammar and pronunciation, the construct is also wrong in thought. Anyone whose universe is dependent on that kind of a control is bound to get out of hand, because this level of control can only exist temporarily. </p>
<p>Another directive derived from this observation points to a rule, that exists in the opposite vector direction. The more power one has, the more gentle one has to be in using that power. There are historical records of leaders who use this principle so strikingly that they exist as the greatest of mankind. And there are also historical facts that show the opposite, confirming power can only exist with the gentle and humble person, or it will evaporate quickly, allowing it to only exist temporarily.</p>
<p>That is why, it is not up to our leaders to tell us what to do, it is up to us to tell the leaders what we desire. If a leader fails to observe our wishes, that leader is no longer a leader and will be treated as such. Remember, the leader exists with the agreement of the people he / she leads. Without the people, without the people to lead, no leader exists.</p>
<p>In conclusion, you probably are astounded that we arrived to describe mankind's greatest leaders from a glass of milk and a cookie.</p>
