</p>
<p>You are the center of the universe. Yes you, the reader. But there's a slight hitch. You the reader, are not the only one. Most or all of humanity believes that he or she is the center of the universe. So how do we reconcile this?</p>
<p>The idea here is that everyone is the center of the universe, and it is shared. Think about digging a hole with a shovel. Even though digging a hole by oneself looks like a solitary experience, it is not. If we look closer, we have to acknowledge the contribution of the person who forged the blade for the shovel, the person who carved the handle, and the person who put it all together to make it a working shovel. But it goes even deeper. Contributions are made by the people who raised the tree for the handle, who mined the ore for the blade and so on.</p>
<p>No man is an island. As you have seen even this simple act of digging, involved contributions from a multitude of people. So, when we believe we are the center of the universe, it is true in the sense, that one is the center of the universe, and we all share a piece. True greatness and achievement comes via the recognition of this power of shared position in the universe.</p>
<p>How is it shared â€¦ you ask? The universe's center is shared based upon the individual's strength. Staying with the shovel metaphor, the person who carved handle is most likely good with wood work. The person who forged the blade is most likely a person with experience with metal. So we all take up the center of the universe based upon our training, our education, our experience, our interests and our predispositions that has been given to us.</p>
<p>In true greatness, is one finds its call when everything comes natural. They say if you find this call, and you work within these parameters, you will never work a day in your life. So whatever you are doing today, ask yourself the question if it is in harmony with your interest in your predispositions and your wishes. If it is you are a happy person. If it is not, strives to find the Avenue that fulfills the above preconditions. You and the people around you, and the society surrounding you will benefit.</p>
<p>The universe achieves balance through your self-expression. Society achieves prosperity, the individual achieves happiness finding this self-expression. Nothing should stand in the way. And if there is an obstacle imposed by another individual, imposed by society or any dictatorship or any empire, remove the obstacle. Remove it with negotiation, peace, honor, integrity, and if necessary, as a last resort, remove the obstacle by force. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Even though you are the center of the universe, so are the other billions of human beings. Share this center of the universe, and create an environment where the cumulative self-expression puts the universe back in balance. If you are a force standing in the way of self-expression, examine the greater picture, and act accordingly. Empower everyone in your path towards achieving this greater self-expression.</p>
