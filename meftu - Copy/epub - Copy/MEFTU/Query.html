</p>
<p>When I walked by a circle of people sitting around the fire, I noticed that they are eating something I have not recognized, perhaps have not seen before. So I posed the query: what are you eating? And they said something that sounded too African for me to comprehend. The answer did not clarify what they were eating, but as I got closer, it became apparent that the circle of men were eating giant black bugs.</p>
<p>As I had cultural bias against eating insects, I was resisting, and immediately posed the next question: How does it taste? The answer came swiftly. Possibly, I was not the first that posed this question, so they had an answer pre-loaded: It tastes like chicken. </p>
<p>Later in life I learned, that many cultures eat insects. In fact, it possibly is the best thing a human can consume, full of protein and several other nutritious ingredients. So why does our culture refrain from eating such a great nutritional item? We may not need to answer that question, but we do need to make an observation about keeping an open mind.</p>
<p>From that same tribe I learned an answer to the most essential human question. The query is: what are two most important days of your life? Of course, we have a commonplace answer to that, and we say that the two most important days of our lives are: The day we were born, and the day we die. The tribe members however had an answer that takes this query to a whole new dimension: The two most important days of your lives are: The day you were born, and the day you find out what you were born for.</p>
<p>Indeed, this creates a whole new context around the aforementioned question. It is more important than anyone would realize, because this context describes: Purpose. Though many find purpose in life, few find it earlier, some later but some never find it. Once a human being finds his / her purpose everything falls into place naturally. Motivation ensues, health improves, relationships forge, and destiny is set. All happens organically. While this description is similar to describing a religious experience, it is more universal than that, as it happens to most every creature.</p>
<p>This transformation of finding a purpose is not the exclusive domain of human beings. If you watch a cat or a dog playing, you can recognize that the dog or cat is preparing all its life for its intended purpose. In fact a difference between the dog's play and the cat's play highlights the different purpose of the different creatures. I would postulate, that every single thing in the universe is fulfilling a purpose, and that thing is only complete when it is on the path of fulfillment.</p>
<p>That purpose is visible in every aspect of our lives. For instance if I eat food that doesn't agree with me, I get a headache, and a mechanism kicks in to restore my well-being. If I nick myself by accident, another mechanism kicks in to heal my wound. And if I permit it, (by rest, cleaning and proper care) it will restore everything to its original state. The query is: how does it know what the original state is? How does it know what is well-being? </p>
<p>We witness miracles every minute. Keep an open mind, be humble, and acknowledge that everything has a purpose. And the universe is greater and stronger then we could ever comprehend. Miracles and all.</p>
