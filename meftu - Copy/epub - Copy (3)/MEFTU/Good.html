<p>I postulate the question about friction: is it Good or is it Bad. Positive or Negative? And by friction I mean the friction between two solid objects like your hand sliding on top of a coffee table.</p>
<p>On the one hand we can say friction is bad. That is why we have to put gas in the car, to fight friction. On the other hand we can say friction is good, because without friction we could not even start off our car from its parking place. </p>
<p>We were looking at a natural phenomena, friction, discovering its duality. It can qualify both as a positive thing and as a negative thing. The error here is that we are trying to quantify good and bad, positive and negative. Good and Bad does not not exist. They are dependent on our point of view. They are just pointy arrows or vectors, which point in a particular direction dependent upon our value system and our point of view. However, in our human existence, we always have an idea of what is good and what is bad. Looking at the vector nature of good and bad, I gather, new guidance is needed on how to navigate the complexity of this matter.</p>
<p>Most importantly you cannot tell 'Good and Bad' apart when you are not calm. You cannot know the difference when you are angry, when you are distracted, when you are not rested. To tell the distinction between good and bad first you need to be at peace, calm and composed. Do whatever it takes to reach a calm state before you render judgment about anything good or bad. Especially if your render has influences or consequences. </p>
<p>The second important guiding rule of 'Good and Bad' are the answers to the following questions: Does it harm anyone or does it harm anything? Does it result in benefits to anyone? Do the benefits outweigh the side effects or the harmful effects? Naturally, the only question that is asked for sure is: Does it benefit / effect me? There is nothing wrong with that question as long as all the other questions are examined as well.</p>
<p>The third important rule of good and bad is examining the need for very question itself. Do we even need to have a good or bad judgment about that (some)thing? We very rarely need to decide. But we do anyway. We live in a society / world that is extremely judgmental, everything is categorized, cataloged, numbered, bagged, tagged, shipped and judged. We do not need to do any of that with matters that do not affect us. Still, we have a strong stance on anything and everything. Shame.</p>
<p>Avoiding judgment is the best course of action. Just like friction cannot be categorized as good or bad most of the things in the universe cannot be categorized either. The wisest way to navigate is to accept things as they are. Acknowledging something as it exists. There are no good or bad things, they are subject to point of view. And more importantly it is more than two quantities. It never is an extreme in one direction or an extreme and another direction, rather, it is a gradient with many many possible values.</p>
<p>There is wisdom in comprehending the universe as it is presented, not as we want it to be. Especially when we look at ourselves. Most happy people possess this special wisdom of self introspection, because acknowledging everything in its correct form, and weighing it according to a happier value system, leads to a balanced and happy life. Wise men look at the universe, and acknowledge it, just as it is. </p>
