</p>
<p>When cleaning the kitchen table, (by wiping it with a rag) however unbelievable this may sound, we are not cleaning anything. We are merely shifting dirt from the table onto the kitchen rag. As far as the universe is concerned one cannot clean. We can only transfer dirt from one place on to a different location. When cleaning the kitchen table with the kitchen rag we are transferring the dirt from the table to the rag and then we are transferring the dirt into the kitchen sink with the assistance of water.</p>
<p>One would interpret that this shifting the dirt metaphor is specific to the cleaning domain. Not so. Physics tells us that matter cannot appear and cannot vanish. It can only be converted. If converted to energy, there is a straight correlation of matter to energy. So energy is conserved as well. It merely changes forms. </p>
<p>There are human implications of this kitchen rag metaphor. For instance; One creature's death is another creature's life. From the creature's point of view it is a matter of life and death, and self protection matters awaken, from the universe's perspective life force got transferred. Another instance; Giving a pay raise to a worker. From the universe's vantage point, currency got reallocated from one worker to the other or from the corporation / boss to the worker. The aforementioned examples prove, that no matter what we do, there are multiple facets of our actions. The issues are complex, always. So when we do something, we have to evaluate all consequences on others and on the universe. </p>
<p>There are questions that one may pose in an attempt to evaluate the effects on the universe. These questions are similar to the questions in the chapter 'Good' with some additions. The questions are: Does my action harm anyone / anything. Does my action result in benefits to anyone? Do the benefits outweigh the side effects or the harmful effects. What is the cost of my action and what is the reward to others to the universe? Lastly, the questions may point inwards to evaluate the benefits for oneself.</p>
<p>Sadly, most of the time, the only questions are asked, concern the benefit for oneself. To paraphrase: a benefit for me. What do I get? As a society, as we advance and develop, people become more and more selfish. Selfish to the degree that they are not even considering the actions and the effects of actions on others and on the universe. The result? Poverty, homelessness, and global pollution. </p>
<p>Intuitively we assume, the richer the country is, the less homelessness it experiences, the less pollution it outputs and the less suffering it imposes on its people. Deplorably, the formula is just the opposite. The richer the country, the more intense the suffering, selfishness, inequality, paranoia. It is interesting, that as society advances, we would expect that happiness, wealth, security, safety grows in proportion, but in reality all of those attributes become worse.</p>
<p>Why is it reverse? Perhaps the kitchen rag deposits more dirt on the table than it removes. There are many things in the universe that are in reverse order in reference to our expectations. When you stand in front of the mirror, and attempt to shake hands with yourself, the wrong hand comes up. You expect to reach across, but you need to raise your hand straight to reach your mirror image. Remember this when you think people misunderstand you. The universe responds not to our image, but to our mirror image.</p>
