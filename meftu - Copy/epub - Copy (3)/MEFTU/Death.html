</p>
<p>Many a times I have been posed the question: 'Why do we die?' The question comes mostly when people are trying to evaluate the meaning of life, or they have lost something dear, like a loss of a loved one.</p>
<p>The answer is hard to digest, because our thinking is strongly influenced by our ego. Yet, when we can put ego aside and observe the universe as it unfolds its magic, we immediately recognize that the universe does not preserve any of its creatures. Instead, it creates an offspring. In the creation of an offspring the universe assures continuity. This also allows for corrections, adaptations. A way to create a more suitable and more survivable instance of the species. We see this whenever we observe animal life or plant life. </p>
<p>It would be foolish to assume that we are not subject to the same rules and laws. Indeed we are an exceptional creature but the universe treats us very much the same way as it treats other creatures. It creates an offspring with better adapted to the currently existing environment. Immediately what comes to mind is observing a teenager handling technology an order of magnitude better than I (or we) ever could. The universe obsoleted me, and there is already an offspring that is ready to create continuation.</p>
<p>And therein lies the key to something new. We die, because the universe renders us obsolete. But we can influence that. Some would say, we can even control that. We can continue to be naive, we can continue to learn, we can continue to adapt. That way, the universe is not seeing an obsolete creature but a very much alive and vibrant, ready to survive instance of the species. Ever wonder why some people go away at fifty and why other people can live as long as a hundred or more?</p>
<p>The common element with people possessing such longevity is the ability to adapt, keeping the curiosity and maintaining the freshness of mind. These things we can control, these things can be totally managed.</p>
<p>Every creature has its lifespan. If you owned a dog (or any pet), you know the pet's lifespan is a lot shorter than that of the human. So every pet owner experiences this loss. But it is not really a loss if you accept the consequences of a shorter lifespan, and ready yourself . That way you can summarize and focus on the good things that happened, and be prepared for the loss, and accept it as the universe presented it.</p>
<p>When loosing a loved one, the same applies. Celebrate the continuation the universe created. Ask yourself: the loved one, that died, would he / she want you to be happy?</p>
