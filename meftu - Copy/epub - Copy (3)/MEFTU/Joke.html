</p>
<p>I have a lot of confrontations arising out of the fact that people address me, and they think that they are joking. But it is not funny, and it is downright dis-respective. Everybody is a comedian. In real life, it is rarely the case. Leave the joking to the professionals, and come forth as your true and honorable self.</p>
<p>By no means I'm trying to say don't joke. Feel free to have fun, where appropriate. Obtain the other person's permission before you do so. Never ever pull a joke on a.) Other people's expense b.) Something obvious c.) A disability or a disadvantage (perceived or not) d.) Joke that demeans or devalues a person / object / culture. </p>
<p>Do not snipe. In this context sniping means that you're going past the person, making a comment and not allowing them time to respond. Typical examples of sniping would be: 'you are fat', or 'you are slow' while jogging on the street â€¦ etc.</p>
<p>Consider the seriousness of false humor. Behind every joke - however abstract - there is a small grain of truth. But the truth is not always an easy factor to deal with. I have no statistical information, but my conjecture is this half of the spontaneous armed shootings start as a joke. Consider before you pull an unsolicited joke with a person; would you be able to handle their response if they produced a weapon?</p>
<p>Do make a joke, that is not at anybody's expense, that is imaginative. That shows a strength as weakness or a weakness as strength. That portrays the universe from an unexpected point of view. Make a joke that is not culture specific. Remember, we are approaching the state of global village. True greatness in joking stands up in front of multiple points of views, in multiple languages, in front of multiple cultural observers. If this sounds too hard, leave the joking to the professionals. </p>
<p>In my journeys, especially in journeys in cultures that are blessed with freedom, people have too easy access to each other. Perhaps because of this easy access, people are disrespectful, people pull jokes easily. Once more, nothing against fun, but things already came too far. Respect each other.</p>
<p>Whenever you encounter another human being, consider, you have encountered another fellow creature that is the most powerful creature the universe had ever produced. And do not let looks fool you. Most of the powerful and influential people do not cater to their looks as the primary means of interaction. Do not be surprised, for instance, the homeless person you walked by every morning; - at one point in time - he created the vaccine that saved your life when you where a child. Most of our greats pass away silently. That is why they are the greats. Respect them. Cherish them.</p>
<p>In some countries, whenever you encounter another human being, they let you know, sometimes enforce, that you have encountered the most powerful creature of the universe. That is the other extreme. As usual, it would be awesome to create a happy middle. Be humble. Be equal. Share. Judge less. Show respect. People go through unimaginable hardships. Help whenever you can. And read on.</p>
