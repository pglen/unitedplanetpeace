</p>
<p>When it comes to medical science mankind made a giant leaps and bounds and we are able to heal most common diseases with little or no effort. Despite those great advances in healing a broken body, very little progress has been made to heal a broken spirit. Medical statistics show a startling trend: the most prescribed and consumed medications are ones that treat psychological disorder, brain unbalance, depression and the like. </p>
<p>Healing a broken spirit is not difficult. Of course, just like everything else once we know how to do it, things become easy. So here's a recipe how to heal a broken spirit. Remember, every recipe or knowledge shared assumes the listener has a certain level of wisdom. So interpret carefully, as we are trying to make things better not worse.</p>
<p>Many times, the broken spirit is coming from a loss of a loved one. The loss is manifesting itself as a loss of expectation in continuity of life with that loved one. Death is part of natural life. Embrace it, celebrate it. And think of the wish of the love one. Would he/she wish you to be sad or would he/she wish you to be happy.</p>
<p>Also frequent, - and serious - is a loss of any kind. An unfulfilled expectation, an unsuccessful adventure or anything that did not fulfill our desire. It may result in depression, withdrawal from society, or simply a total surrender. The surrender may result in alcoholism, or addictions of other kind. The the cure is easy. Dispose of the expectation that created the unbalance. Look at things as they are, not as you want them to be. Let go of your vision and accept reality. </p>
<p>Let me give you an example of false expectations. When I was a child, I was watching a Sci-Fi movie, and noticed the laboratory scientists wearing a white laboratory coat. I decided, when I grow up, I want to be a laboratory scientist like that. I want to wear a white laboratory coat, and do important things. However, to my great disappointment, I did not become a laboratory scientist. So according to my missing expectation I should be sad. </p>
<p>But I understood that I created that expectation when I was not old enough to really create an expectation. I filled up the whole chalkboard with expectations, even though I had insufficient information at the time. The cure is to erase that chalkboard, and create a new fresh set of expectations to replace the old ones. Better still, leave the chalkboard empty and accept the universe as it is. In my example, if I would focus on my disappointment of not wearing a white laboratory coat, I would miss the glory and the grandeur of my current life today. Because I am creating things that are just as important or even more important than any laboratory coat wearing scientists can create.</p>
<p>Erase your chalkboard of expectations. Most of those were created with little insight, too early in life to be of any realistic value. The type of partner you envision for yourself, the type of person you aspire to be, the type of environment you want to be in â€¦ are all expectations you created at the time when you had inadequate information to create them. According to ancient saying, the number one cause of human suffering is expectations. Erase yours. Create new ones. So you can be happy.</p>
