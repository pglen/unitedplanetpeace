<p>When navigating the spiritual universe, conventional physics do not apply. Somewhat similar to particle physics and quantum theory, where conventional physics do not apply either.</p>
<p>Here is what I mean. When you have a box of fries in your hand, and give some of it to your friend, you end up with less fries. But when you are in a good mood, smile, laugh and share it with your friend, you end up with more smiles and more laughs than you had originally. This is where conventional physics breaks down. When you share something spiritual, you end up receiving more.</p>
<p>It does not have to be a friend that you share with. It can be a stranger. The more you share the more you end up with. You can share a kind word or a thoughtful observation. Even a joke. Be mindful that a kind word is language neutral and cross-cultural, a joke may be culture specific. So when you choose your spiritual bridge, make sure you do not create a joke that is at the other person's expense (or at anyone's expense for that matter). Be gentle, be universal and share genuinely. Whatever you share allow a dialogue to take place, do not snipe or create a one-way communication. Be kind and accept whatever response you get, and accept it graciously. No matter what perceived pecking order you are in.</p>
<p>Even though conventional laws of physics do not apply, whatever you are sharing you are in the other person's personal space. Be very conservative on what you output, and very liberal on what you accept. There is no better way to bridge the gap between cultures than to share a laugh, and communicate with a smile. It is very easy, because the more you share the more you have for yourself.</p>
<p>The universe presents a mirror image of ourselves. You stand in front of a mirror, and you try to shake hands with your mirror image. Notice, the wrong hand comes up in the mirror. A very strong metaphor for how we are perceived in the universe, and how we perceive things. We have to acknowledge that our mirror image is not what we think it is. We need to accept it, and take good care of presenting the best possible image without games, layers and pretense. This calls for being genuine, being helpful and being honorable. And that is in the spiritual realm, so the more we do it, the more we get back. As opposed to fries, where the more we share, the less we have.</p>
<p>This mirror image presents interesting side effects. For example if we think another person as hostile, we are the hostile one. If we think another person is paranoid, we are paranoid. This side effect also goes to unexpected corners like mirroring the behavior of a whole society or a whole country. Just think of a war situation. Where we believe we should attack, kill, destroy, we are dealing with our mirror image. Wanted or not, our mirror image creates the attack - kill - destroy scenario on both sides.</p>
<p>It is essential that we accept our own mirror image. And to project a mirror image worthy of imitation, worthy of acceptance, worthy of remembering.</p>
