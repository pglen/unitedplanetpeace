</p>
<p>What a tangled web we weave. Everything is connected to everything someway, somehow. When you read the chapters in this book, you witnessed this contentedness. Chapters interweave, concepts intertwine. A concept expressed in one section, turned upside down or modified in the other. </p>
<p>It is not on purpose though. This is how the universe is constructed. We simply want to capture a particular point of view, but any vantage point sees into this complex web. The point of view we have chosen, is to expose a universe in motion, and humanities's progress towards the global village. </p>
<p>The intent of this document is to inspire everyone to a new code of behavior. One that promotes peace, coexistence, self expression and happiness. Where no person is left behind. Where everybody has access to human dignity and basic needs. In the twenty first century we have access to all the means to easily fulfill this mission. All we need is the wisdom and insight to share and help each other.</p>
<p>We need to start open dialog with true participation. Without that, we will end up with policies that promote roach farming, or worse, play games like defaulting on bills for international organizations. We need to start accepting the universe as it is, and create our future from that.</p>
<p>After reading these messages, I am sure you are ready for messages level two. It will continue the exciting journey into the universe with more miracles and more magic. Stay tuned â€¦.</p>
