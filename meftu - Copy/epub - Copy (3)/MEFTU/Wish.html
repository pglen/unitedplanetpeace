</p>
<p>We all wish for things from time to time. But the universe is very specific when it comes to wishes. A friend of mine wished for more money, and his job offered him overtime. He had more money, but he had to work a lot more. Later he recalled, that he was not specific enough in his wish, he should have wished for more money with less work.</p>
<p>In the near past, there was a record jackpot on the lottery. How many people wished to hit that jackpot? And of course, one person did hit it. Was he happy? Yes, in the short term. Looking at past lottery winners, most of them declare bankruptcy, some of them die unexpectedly, all of them are hounded by friends they didn't know they had. At the final count, very few of them actually enjoyed this new and enormous wealth. What is the message the universe here? What is it saying concerning great wealth?</p>
<p>I know a lot of really wealthy people. But I can clearly state, that wealth and happiness are not connected traits. In fact, quite the opposite. Most of the wealthy people I know are unhappy. They are afraid of losing their wealth. They are fully occupied with maintaining their perceived condition, and overpowered by maintaining outward appearance. Because outward appearance is utmost importance for most of the wealthy. They want to distinguish themselves form others. In realism, most of the times, this was the driving force that made them wealthy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There is nothing wrong on being wealthy. Most wealthy people create wealth by creating abundance for others, and as a result, create abundance for themselves. The problem comes with the cases where the abundance is created with exploitation, fraud, bullying. I wish the wealthy person examines the abundance he / she created versus the abundance he received. As a society, we need to examine if any person's wealth is backed up by matching contribution on creating that wealth. </p>
<p></p>
<p>They say, it is not having what you like, but liking what you have. It goes for all things, not just wealth. Happy and successful people are the ones who master the art of accepting their current reality, and carry it with a happy disposition. For instance, an elderly lady I know, was constantly grumpy. I spoke to her and explained, that she has a wonderful and positive reality, and she has the choice of carrying that with grace, or carrying it with a grouch or as a burden. Her eyes lit up, and she made the connection to carry her current life with gracefulness. In context, she was well in her seventies, but this was the first time she have ever heard those words of wisdom.</p>
<p>Finally, down to my wishes. I have to make it specific, simple, and on target. By no means I can wish for everything, so I compiled a shortlist. I wish that:</p>
<p></p>
<p>People will treat each other as they expect to be treated,</p>
<p>We learn the difference between the want and the need,</p>
<p>That we see the universe for what it is, not what we want it to be,</p>
<p>We find out how to share, respect each other and help each other,</p>
<p>And we can live in harmony with each other and the universe.</p>
<p>Wealth, achievements, possessions do not matter if we have no human context to enjoy it in. </p>
