</p>
<p>In the vastness of the universe, everything is connected. Everything affects us. According to the reverse distance rule, the further something is, the less it has an effect on us. How about something that is so close, that is within us. Like food. Indeed, nothing affects us as severely, as profoundly, as the food we eat, and as the liquid we drink.</p>
<p>In search for the perfect food, mankind has iterated all kinds of exotic and strange food materials. And the perfect food was right in front of us. The apple. In fact, no other edible object has more parables attached to it. For instance: 'The apple does not fall far from its tree' or 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away' ... and so forth. </p>
<p>By itself, the apple is incomplete nutrition. To search for complete nutrition, we can look at an time honored dish or an ancient [traditional] feast. Recent nutritional studies confirmed, that the nutritional balance of those dishes are exactly what a human being needs as complete nutrition.</p>
<p>But taking a closer look at our current nutrition reveals that tradition has misled us. For instance, we routinely consume milk, but we do not have the enzyme to digest it's main nutrition. Mother nature made sure, that our enzyme to digest lactose recedes, essentially weaning us off mother's breasts. Hence the numerous cases of lactose intolerance. In reality every adult is lactose intolerant, as the enzyme is largely receded. Still, not everyone develops symptoms.</p>
<p>As a rule, if one person is allergic to a particular nutrition, everyone is allergic to it. But not everyone develops symptoms. Wheat allergy, peanut allergy, (By the way peanut is a relative of poison ivy) are all allergies that are universally affecting everybody, but with a different degree of effect. </p>
<p>Our digestive system has evolved over millenniums, and if we pay attention to its evolution, we can deduce what good or bad nutrition is. For instance, accepting our ancestry as the primitive man, he did not have access to means of toppling a cow or a bull. Hence our digestive system did not have training to digest large mammal meat. Even though it is a consumable nutrition, by no means it is ideal nutrition. </p>
<p>In search for idea nutrition, we can look for a good example in the eastern cultures. Their nutrition has no allergenic ingredients. In opposition to that, take a look at the western fast food offerings. Every single item on the menu has allergenic ingredient, from wheat to large mammal meat to synthetic food to ingredients that do not even have pronounceable names. </p>
<p>Remembered the reverse distance rule. Nothing will have more effect than something with negative distance (actually within you). Choose wisely. Request all-knowing. </p>
<p>Food for thought, the second most important effect is still coming from within. It is our mental nourishment. What we focus on, what we consider, what we allow in. If we permit - poison / jealousy / greed, or if we elect happiness, abundance, sharing - will determine our mental nourishment. But that is the subject for a whole new chapter. Read on.</p>
